1.Write a java program that merges  two list of integer into a single list . Ensure that the final list contains all the elements from both the list 
without duplicates . Use appropriate  collection interfaces to achieve this

2.create a class student with properties like name and marks . write a java program that stores a list of students  object in an  ArrayList .
 sort the list based on student marks in ascending order and display the  sorted list
NOte : use sort() of collection class

3.Implement vector class for this problem 
Create an Employee class will have details like EmployeeNo,EmployeeName and Address . You should pass value for EmployeeNo, EmployeeName and Address
through constructor.
Create a method addInput() which will add employee details to vector.
create method dispaly() which should display all data from vector using Enumeration .



Note addInput() and display() should not be member function of Employee class.
